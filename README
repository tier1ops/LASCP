This collection of php- and bashscripts shall help you to manage your ArmA2 linux dedicated server. Designed for the usage on a testserver the MSCP can start, stop and update the server. It provides also the possibility to upload missions.

Although MSCP works great for us, we do not provide any warranty or guaranteed support for it.
However we're glad to help you, if needed.

SETUP:
1. Install MSCP into a web-accessible directory.
2. Secure it with a .htaccess
3. Copy the lines from doc/sudoers into your sudoers list. Make sure to replace www-data with the username, your Apache runs with.
4. Copy aceupdater into your ArmA directory and make it executable if neccessary.
5. chmod +x on inc/cp_file.sh and inc/run_server.sh if needed.
6. Change the path in inc/cp_file.sh and inc/run_server.sh to reflect your ArmA2 directory.
7. Change the settings in inc/config.php


TODO-List:
* Add installer
* Add user-/sessionmanagement
* Add option to customize the server.cfg trough the webinterface
* Add Logging to see if people are doing bullshit with the tool
* Add the option to start server with diffrent modstrings
* Add posibility to alter the mods on the server (to add mods, etc.)
* Give us your featurerequests on the bugtracker
